SUBJECT: Concerning your "<PROJECT_NAME>" project ;)


Hi <NAME>!


I just saw <PROJECT_NAME> and I really like it! Well done ;)

I just launched a service that helps projects like yours to be boosted a little bit  faster...
Basically, when I create a great project like yours, I always submit it to Hacker News, Reddit, ProductHunt, BetaList, …

Doing this can really boost your project, but is not the most exciting job.., isn’t it?

That's why I just launched ProjectNinja which does everything for you.
Since I'm looking for early birds like you (in order to get some feedback), it is totally free for your -> https://projectninja.pw

Feel free to try it and let me know your thoughts ;)


Thanks,
Pierre
